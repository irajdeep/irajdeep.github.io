Surprisingly this is not my first take on writing; an attempt was made in the year 2010, after my 10th standard high school exams, when I was visiting my grandparents. My grandfather was a voracious writer; he used to write as a hobby for local magazines and newspapers on almost any topic. He didn't have any strong preference for the kind of writing; at times, it used to be short stories, another time essays, and then something else. It would be fair to say that observing him was my first inspiration for trying out writing â€“ I aspired to write short stories back then, but one thing led to another, and it never happened.

So twelve years later, what brings me here, you ask? To be honest, I don't know; I don't think I have a definitive answer here. My current take on writing is mostly around consolidating the thoughts I've been having for quite some time now. Most of these thoughts are personal, so probably they won't make it to this blog, but having said that, there are topics and learnings which I would like to put here. At this point, I don't know how committed I would be to maintaining this blog; I don't even know what I will be writing about, maybe book reviews, or interesting things that I've learned, my rants, am not sure. 

But over the last few months, writing things down has undoubtedly helped me in some ways; for example, if I am feeling confused or unhappy about something, I often end up writing letters to a person without sending them. Somehow having a person in mind to whom you have to explain the whole mess to really helps focus the thoughts and figure out where you stand more easily. 

Anyway, I am hoping to keep up with the practice this time : -)
