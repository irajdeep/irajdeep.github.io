When I was a kid, I thought the extraordinary thing in life would be to travel around the world, see interesting things, meet interesting people, and experience exciting places. This, in turn, would make me a more interesting person, a worthwhile human being worthy of adoration. Somehow our generation was taught that our experiences solely define us. Having traveled quite a bit over the years, I don't think I have had any self-discovery. I did meet a few interesting people, but we never kept in touch; I didn't have an epiphany, nor did I have any sustained change in my thought process. I don't think the experience I gained from traveling has given me much satisfaction beyond filling a couple of minutes in a passing cocktail party conversation.
		
I think travel as a universal solution for everyone, and every problem is overdone. And with the social media outburst, the culture of "traveler" and "wanderer" is shoved into your brain. I have definitely enjoyed traveling as well, but that was predominantly because of the company I traveled in; friends and family with whom I've traveled have made those experiences special if I remove the people from the equation, I don't think I had many meaningful or profound experiences.

This post is not meant to demotivate you from gaining your travel experiences; you should continue to do so if it makes you happy and satisfied. But if you're like me, who felt indoctrinated into thinking that taking a backpack and traveling around the world is the single greatest thing one can do, but doing so didn't make you feel any special, you're not alone.
