Music has shaped my life for over decades now; it has been through the thick and thin, through joys and sorrows. Over time I've associated music with specific memories. There are times when I've been listening to a song for the hundredth time in a month, and when I hear that song again at some point later, all those memories come rushing back, good or bad.

Few of my fond memories of both child and adulthood are associated with music. Growing up, I have a recollection of accompanying my mother to her singing lessons; I would sit by the side trying to make sense of the [Sargam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargam_(music)), often phasing out while staring at the various musical instruments. Thereafter in university, I got introduced to the world of rock, which started with psychedelic rock which may or may not have a relation to me trying out psychedelic in university; Pink Floyd, The Doors, Tame Impala, etc, and after that, the exploration continued. This series of blog posts, ***"What I've been listening to"*** is planned to be a (bi?)monthly series where I intend to pen down a few of the songs or bands that have stuck with me over that month.

So here goes the ***"What I've been listening to"*** August edition -

I think George Harrison is the most underrated Beatles member. The charisma of John Lenon and Paul Mccartney seem to have shadowed the limelight George deserved. He wrote few of my favorite Beatles songs, "While My Guitar Gently Weeps", "Here Comes the Sun,". As a solo artist, George Harrison has been the most successful Beatles member. I was reliving his iconic album "All things must pass," and I stumbled upon this gem from the collection. I would recommend giving the entire album a listen, but if you're an impatient fellow, maybe start with this one.

Another one from the same album, "All Things Must Pass," is "Let It Roll." These two songs are an excellent introduction to the general theme and rhythm of the album.

"The Shins" is the band that got me into the "indie" music genre. Their third album, "Wincing the Night Away," is my favorite Shins album, especially the song "Australia" and "Sleeping Lessons".

Another George Harrison track. By now probably, you can see the pattern in this series; I think this is one of the most powerful charity songs ever composed. It was composed as part of "The Concert for Bangladesh" album for a charity event in aid of homeless Bengali refugees of the [Bangladesh Liberation War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War). The entire [album](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0158560/) is iconic in that it brought together a group of legendary musicians like Ravi Shankar, Bob Dylan, George Harrison, and such.

These are pretty much the songs and albums that stuck with me over the last month, and I hope you enjoy them as well. Cheers.
