A close friend of mine who has been unhealthily obsessed with Neuroscience and Psychology for quite some time introduced me to Karl Diesseroth through the [Lex Friedman podcast](https://youtu.be/OaeYUm06in0). This podcast is an extraordinary conversation. I finished the podcast with a sense that Dr. Deisseroth is a renaissance man. A man who has the ability to move humanity forward (possibly towards less suffering) with his work.

He mentions his book [Projections](https://www.amazon.com/Projections-Story-Emotions-Karl-Deisseroth/dp/1984853694) in the podcast, which I just finished. It's one of those rare books where the author has tried to explain two unparallel concepts – emotions and science and has done a fabulous job in beautifully bridging them. Foremostly working as a psychiatrist, he portrays his work of treating clinically distressed people in a way that is much of an art as science. Each chapter is a personal story about a distinct mental disorder, using narrative and neuroscience to span the gulf between patient and caregiver. The coherence of the writing style and the mental disorder described in each chapter is quite natural and felicitous – for example, in the chapter on schizophrenia, the language is a bit fragmented, and the chapter on grief is mellowed down; similarly, the chapter talking about mania has a euphoric tone. 

Dr. Deisseroth has also worked on innovative diagnostic techniques like optogenetics, which he talks about in good detail – optogenetics could be holding the arsenal to diagnose the darker and mysterious parts of the brain with greater accuracy. 

With each chapter, I saw myself getting more convinced with the idea of how thin is the line between normality and abnormality and how vulnerable each of us is getting just tipped over onto the farther side of the spectrum. The narrative does an exemplary job exploring the girth of suffering around some mental disorders – disorders either induced by neurological complications and/or tragic events.

This book has left me both melancholic and weirdly optimistic. If not for the science, it is definitely worth reading because of the alluring storytelling.
